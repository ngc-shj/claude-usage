# Status line that also records the plan's rate-limit percentages.
#
# Why this exists: `/usage` prints a percentage and forgets it. Nothing local
# keeps a timestamped history, so the cost of a batch cannot be recovered once
# it is over. This log is that history — ordered, per window, monotonically
# filtered — and two of its lines can be subtracted.
#
# IT WAS ALSO BUILT FOR SUB-PERCENT RESOLUTION, AND THAT PREMISE HAS NOT HELD.
# `/usage` floors to integers while the payload appeared to carry decimals, but
# across the first 27 logged readings every value was a whole percent, and the
# two that looked otherwise — 14.000000000000002 and 28.000000000000004 — are
# `0.14 * 100` and `0.28 * 100` to the bit. The server quantizes to 1% and
# scales; the trailing digits are float noise, not precision. So read the
# resolution as 1% of the window until a reading arrives that is not a whole
# percent. This hook rounds nothing, which is what leaves that falsifiable:
# such a reading would be logged exactly as it came. tests/ pins it.
#
# WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO READINGS MEANS. The log measures ACCOUNT-WIDE
# usage, not this batch's, so `after - before` is:
#   - an UPPER BOUND on the batch, when both readings sit in the same window
#     (identical `resets_at`) and the closing one is fresh — anything else you
#     or another device did lands in the same figure;
#   - INVALID, not merely loose, when a window rolled over between them, when
#     either reading is stale, or when a field is missing. A rollover can make
#     the difference negative or spuriously small, so it is not conservative in
#     any direction.
# Matching the model, effort and agent shape is NOT needed for the subtraction
# itself; it is what licenses extrapolating the result to a different batch.
#
# EACH WINDOW IS JUDGED ALONE. The five-hour and seven-day figures roll over on
# different schedules and either may be absent from a payload, so a reading is
# accepted or rejected per window. A window that is missing, that went
# backwards, or whose reset moved backwards is written as `null` rather than
# carried forward from the previous line — carrying it forward would invent an
# observation that was never made. A consumer subtracting one window skips the
# lines where it is null.
#
# WHAT IS LOGGED, and nothing else: a timestamp, the two percentages and their
# reset boundaries. The payload also carries the session id, the transcript
# path and the working directory; none are written. tests/ pins that.
#
# Usage: configured as `statusLine.command` in ~/.claude/settings.json, pointing
# at the copy install.sh puts in ~/.claude/usage/. Claude Code runs it on each
# render and passes the session JSON on stdin. claude-usage-poll.sh feeds it the
# same shape so both writers share one lock, frontier, and format.

#
# A held lock is reclaimed ONLY when its owner is provably gone (`kill -0`).
# Age is never evidence of death — a suspended laptop or a stalled write can
# exceed any threshold with the writer alive — and an unreadable owner file is
# not evidence either: there is a sub-millisecond window between `mkdir`
# succeeding and the owner being written, and an age-based fallback treated a
# lock in that window as ancient and stole it. That race only appeared under
# load, which is what a concurrency test running late in a full suite provides.
# So an unreadable owner means WAIT, and exhausting the retries means fail
# closed. A lock whose creator died inside that window is never reclaimed
# automatically; the status line says `usage-log!` until it is removed by hand.
